Arctic Bio Map is a private service managed by the [GeoSensorWeb Lab](http://sensorweb.geomatics.ucalgary.ca) at the University of Calgary. Releases are provided for new features, bug fixes, and security updates. The HTTP API is tested before each release. After release the services are monitored by a service run by the GeoSensorWeb Lab. Each release will be accompanied by commits and changelog updates on the [git repository](https://github.com/GeoSensorWebLab/arctic-biomap-server).
